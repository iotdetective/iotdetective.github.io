            </div>The Sandbox I&rsquo;m going to continue on the path of sanitization when it comes to conducting online investigations. Every training I have even attended that deals with online open source investigations emphasizes the need to obfuscate your online identity.

            </div>Digital Officer Safety We are all ingrained with a law enforcement concern, that above all else, officer safety is key. Investigators sometimes lose sight of what this means for them in their role. This is mainly due to the large scale differences between patrol and investigative work, but we shouldn&rsquo;t underestimate the need for officer safety in all that we do.
