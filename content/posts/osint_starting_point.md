## Intro
Most people often wonder where to start in their open source intelligence investigations, and rightfully so. There are a host of options to choose from when trying to search the web for intelligence based information on suspects and witnesses. Yes, the starting point should be a simple Google search for name, telephone number, username, etc. However, there are outside options that should be attempted if you come up dry during your initial search engine based attempts at locating information. What are the options, how do I memorize them all, and how do I search for specific pieces of information that you canâ€™t typically locate in a Google search?
## Suggestions
My suggestion to kicking off a more in depth open source investigation is to utilize the OSINT Framework, located at [https://osintframework.com/](https://osintframework.com). Why do I suggest starting your search here? Well, because it offers an easy framework for locating the specific information you are searching for. For example, if your search is based off of a phone number you can select that option and locate a number of online resources that specifically assist you in locating information relative to the phone number you are researching. There are a number of services provided that search for specific pieces of information related to:

* IP Address
* Email Address
* Public Records
* Usernames
* Digital Currency
* Dark Web
## Conclusion
Having these tools available to you in one convenient location, where links are monitored and new service are added frequently, is a must. Start exploring the OSINT Framework today and start finding the information you need to help you gather leads and online evidence in your investigations.
