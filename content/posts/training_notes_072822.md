# Taining Notes
Originally Published on July 28, 2021

## Search operators and their functions:

* “site:” – Use this feature to search for something within a specific website, an example may be site:facebook.com Conway Police Department

* “filetype:” – This operator can be used to locate specific file types, like a work document or a PDF file.
    
* “intext:” – Use this operator to search for text within a word or PDF file, or within a blog article.
    
* Quotations – Quotations around text ensure that you search for the exact phrase and case of the text, for example if you wish to search for Oh say can you see, you will get any webpage with those words included. To narrow down your search type, “Oh say can you see”.
    
* Google Alerts – Set up alerts based on new search strings that appear on Google, for instance your name of where you work. [Check it out here](https://www.google.com/alerts)

## Search for data about people and phone numbers:

* [Family Tree Now](https://familytreenow.com) – Phone numbers, emails, addresses, family members, and associates.

* [US Phonebook](https://usphonebook.com) – Phone numbers, and addresses, this one tends to be more accurate with phone numbers in my experience.

* [ThatsThem](https://thatsthem.com) – Phone numbers, addresses, IP addresses, and emails. This is a good one for historical IP address data, typically the information is older, however. Make sure to check the “updated” date.

## Technology OSINT tools:

* [ARIN](https://arin.net) – Used to determine service provider for an assigned IP address or domain name.

* [WhatIsMyIPAddress](https://whatismyipaddress.com) – Used to geolocate IP addresses, relatively accurate but may be off by neighboring towns or cities.

## Property Tax Info:

* [AXIS GIS Tax Maps](https://axisgis.com) – Mapping feature with property tax data and boundary line data. Not all towns and cities are available within their database.

* [EB2GOV Online Tax Payments](https://pay.eb2gov.com) – Search property tax cards and billing by owner name, address, or lot number.

## Other tools you should know about:

* [NH Business Lookup](https://quickstart.sos.nh.gov/online/Account/LandingPage) – Business search for legal service and D.B.A. (Doing Business As) names.

* [Search.org](https://search.org) – Use their resources section and select ISP list to find information on almost every major American corporation and their legal process as well as contact information for their legal team for subpoena’s and search warrants.

* [OSINT Framework](https://osintframework.com) – Great starting point for finding open-source information in multiple different areas.

* [SnapMap](https://map.snapchat.com) – Great intelligence about towns and cities and what activities are taking place.
