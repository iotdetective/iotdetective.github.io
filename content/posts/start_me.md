## What is Start.me?
Start.me pages have been around for a little while.  As best as I can tell from my own research, the Wayback Machine indicates that Start.me was first operation in 2014.

> Start.me enables people to browse the internet more efficiently. We provide a fully customizable start page that works across all your browsers and devices. Pages can be shared with others, so your co-workers can also benefit from your collection of online resources and web organization skills. [^1]

Start.me has a free signup tier that will give you access to the most common bookmarking and note-taking features for up to three different Start.me pages.  If you are logged into the service, you can also embed other pages and RSS feeds into your page, or create to-do lists which can be helpful online. 

The service can be even more useful when you work with a team of people in order to accomplish a similar set of goals using online resources. For example, I have created a Start.me page with OSINT resources just for those at my agency to use when they need help finding a person, phone number, address, or other open source information online.

## Example
As mentioned above, I have created my own simple Start.me page with a common simplified list of tools that I use most often when conducting OSINT searches online for my work. A screenshot of the page is listed above for your reference, you can visit the page by clicking on the screenshot.

> **Warning**
> Understand that when you create public Start.me pages, they can be discovered publicly by any user on the internet, if you wish to keep your resources private this may not be the option for you.

## Why do I use Start.me?
It is both easy to build and easy to deploy. Deployment options vary, I have sent page links via email via email to share with others. I have also deployed Start.me pages through group policy in order to ensure that everyone has the same home page and all of the resources they may need during the course of their shift.

## Is the paid version worth it?
Honestly, I couldn't accurately answer this question. I haven't dabbled with the paid version of the product, but the big difference in the paid service is the added feature widgets you can place on your start me pages, along with ads being removed, and the ability to create more than just the 3 free resource pages. None of the paid options are required for my use case, but if there is a feature you think you might need, then I would suggest that you check out [Start.me](https://start.me) and see what it can offer for your workflow!
